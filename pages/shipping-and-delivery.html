					receiver location 2 to 3 times in case of any delivery issues. This has been enabled to benefit our customers
					to receive the parcel at any cost. But beyond the specified limit of trying to deliver the parcel at the
					mentioned address by the customer, the parcel shall be retained at the courier company for pickup by the
					customer themselves. Again, retainment of the parcel at the courier office after multiple unsuccessful
					deliveries depends on the location and the courier service. The customer is requested to provide an address
					where someone would be available to collect the parcel during courier service normal working hours to avoid
					delivery failures. On account of failure, they may reach out to us on email on the below mentioned id for the
					address of the courier office to collect the same.</p>
