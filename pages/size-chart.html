        <h3>To Determine Your Bangle Size</h3>
        <p>This is a chart that will be extremely helpful for you to determine the bangle size that you need.
        </p>
        <p>Step 1: Close your fingers together and bring your thumb to your little finger (as pictured).Pretend
          that you
          were putting on a bangle.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Using a strip of paper or tape measurements, wrap it around your hand at the widest point..
          If you
          are using a plain strip of paper, mark your size with a pen on that paper. Then measure that paper
          strip with a ruler. That would be the circumference of your hand.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Compare your hand circumference to the chart below. Purchase a bangle with diameter that is
          the next
          size up from your actual hand measurement.</p>

        <h3>Necklace Size Chart</h3>
        <p>Neck size can be measured easily by using a sewing (soft) measuring tape. Wrap this tape around the
          base of your neck to determine neck size. If you don’t have a soft measuring tape, then you can also
          use a yardstick, ruler or stiff metal measuring tape. In this case, you need to wrap a ribbon around
          the base of your neck, mark the spot where it meets, and then lay it against the yardstick or metal
          measuring tape to determine neck size.</p>
